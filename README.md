**User Guide for Sorting Algorithm Visualizer**
Introduction

Welcome to the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer! This interactive tool helps you understand how different sorting algorithms work by visualizing their step-by-step execution. Whether you're a student learning algorithms or a developer refreshing your knowledge, this visualizer makes abstract concepts tangible.
Getting Started
Accessing the Visualizer

    Open the visualizer in your web browser

    You'll see the main interface with several control panels

    Click "Start Visualizing" to begin

Interface Overview
Main Control Panel

    Stack Section:

        Toggle options like "Quotes", "Compare", and "Generate New Array"

        Checkboxes allow you to enable/disable features

Array Configuration

    Size Options:

        Choose from preset sizes (15 elements)

        Enter a custom number (row 60)

        Select "Custom Array" or "Use Test Array File"

Speed Controls

Adjust the visualization speed with these presets:

    0.25s (fastest)

    0.8s

    0.75s

    1.35s

    1.5s

    2s

    3s (slowest)

Monitoring Tools


    Pause: Temporarily halt the visualization

    Reset: Reset the sorting

Performance Metrics

    Swaps: Shows the number of element swaps (currently 0)

    Time: Displays elapsed time (currently 0s)

Algorithm Information

    Most Common Uses: Describes practical applications of each algorithm

    Algorithm Definition: Provides theoretical background

    Code (Java): Shows implementation in Java

Available Sorting Algorithms

    Bubble Sort

    Selection Sort

    Insertion Sort

    Merge Sort

    Quick Sort

    Heap Sort

How to Use the Visualizer
Basic Operation

    Generate an Array:

        Click "Generate New Array" to create a random dataset

        Or select "Custom Array" to input your own values

    Select an Algorithm:

        Choose from the available sorting algorithms

        Each has a "Play" button to start visualization

    Adjust Settings:

        Set the array size

        Choose visualization speed

        Enable/disable monitoring features

    Run the Visualization:

        Click the "Play" button for your selected algorithm

        Watch as the algorithm processes the array

Advanced Features

    Compare Algorithms:

        Enable the "Compare" option to run multiple algorithms side-by-side

        Observe differences in their approaches and performance

    Step Through:

        Use "Search Step" to move through the algorithm one step at a time

        Pause at any point to examine the current state

    Performance Analysis:

        Monitor the "Swaps" and "Time" counters

        Compare these metrics across different algorithms

Understanding the Visualizations

Each algorithm is represented differently:

    Bubble Sort: Shows elements "bubbling up" to their correct positions

    Selection Sort: Highlights the current minimum element being selected

    Insertion Sort: Demonstrates how elements are inserted into their correct place

    Merge Sort: Visualizes the divide-and-conquer approach with merging subarrays

    Quick Sort: Shows the pivot selection and partitioning process

    Heap Sort: Illustrates the heap structure and extraction process

Tips for Effective Learning

    Start with smaller arrays (15 elements) to clearly see each step

    Begin with slower speeds to observe the algorithm's logic

    Compare how different algorithms handle the same dataset

    Note the number of swaps and time taken for each approach

    Try sorting nearly-sorted and reverse-sorted arrays to see performance differences

Troubleshooting

    If the visualization freezes, try refreshing the page

    Ensure you've generated an array before selecting an algorithm

    For custom arrays, verify your input follows the required for
